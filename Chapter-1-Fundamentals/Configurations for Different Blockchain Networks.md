Suggested parts of the model you can build on when encountering a new network.
- Nodes and Role: What are the different roles in the network for  nodes? What are the ways the nodes join the network and aquire their different roles?
- Consensus Mechanism: Always good to know for a blockchain network, will typically let you know whether a network is public, private or consortium. Typicaally also lets you know the processing limit
- Periods: Two Generaal Periods in Proof Work: Block Production and Block Propagation, In any network what are the different periods the network goes through s it achieves distributed consensus?
- Cryptographic Primitives: Ver technicaal and advanced, best to know cryptographic family and implementation the network ues foe its hashing and encryption can shed some light on a network. Mainly, if a network is using zero-knowledge proofs or something draamatically differnt from another network.
- Level of Decentralization: Variable and may involve incorporating the above data points to determine the level of decentralization. Or the network is private or a testnet and will openly state that its more centralized since thats appropriate for its function
- Reason for Being: another variable but can be very telling to ask why another blockahin network needs to exist. Not because they are perfect, but rather because the answer will hopefully provide some more context into how the network is differnt from networking you are more familiar with. Can port over what you already know about your faavorite blockhcain network to better understand another

## Other Variable Inlcude
1. Governance Structure: How does the network commuity decide on updates, fixes
2. Developer community size and support
3. Network size: How many nodes are there?
4. Open or Closed Source: Can anyone view or contribute to the implementation code online?

## Comparison of popular blockchain netowrks

Other aspect of comparing blockchain is the concept of crosschain compatibility or blockchain interoperability.
- the ability of public blockchains to share network data with each other
- how can we get a multi-chain world, where there are many significant blockchain networks, rathern than hvaing one chain monopolize
- blockchain interoperability seeks to leverage differnt strengths and minimze weakness of existing chains
