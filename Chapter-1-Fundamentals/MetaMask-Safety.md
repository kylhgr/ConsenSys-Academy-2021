# How Does MetaMask Keep Your Keys Safe?
MetaMask is a user consent tools with a broad impact beyond public blockchains
- the private key is never passed outside of MetaMask

## LavaMoat
LavaMoat is a set of tools for securing JavaaScript projects against a category of attacked called software supply chain attacks.
- this genre of attacks occur when a malicious dependency makes its way into a developers application
- An attacker could use the vulnerable dependency to then steal important secrets like credit card numbers, private keys, or personsal data
- These attacks have occuurred in the software systems, due to alarger phenomenon exemplified by the wide use of `npm install` when working on projects.
- each `NPM WARN` signal can be easily ignored, but these attacak have occurred in the software system. Each dependencies caan be potential backdoor.

### Supply Chain Attacks
*SolarWinds attacaj on the US Federal Goverenment Systems is an example of Supply  Chain Issues*

Supply chain attacks present a significant risk for the developers and users of waallets and applications.
- to help mitigate the risk of such aan attack, MetaMask is building a suite of tools that range from Node-Base runtime, to plugins for common application *(webpack, browserify)*, to dependency analysis and visualization tools.

The goal of LavaMoaat is to bring added protection to modern JavaScript apps without having to rewrite them from scratch and automate a good first-start security configuration.
