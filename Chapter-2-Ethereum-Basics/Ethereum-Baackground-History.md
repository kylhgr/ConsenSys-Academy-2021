# Brief overview of the Ethereum Network

## Background
Vitalik Buterin became interested in developing more computing capacity for the Bitcoin network.
- Bitcoin does have a programming language, Script

*Colored Coins and RSK have tried to introduce extra programming capacity on top of the Bitcoin Network*

## Launch of Ethereum

Eth Testnet Launch: May 2015
Eth Public Mainnet Launch: Fronter - July 2015

**Ethereum differs from and overlaps with  Bitcoin in a few ways**
- Consensus Mechanism: Eth & Bitcoin both use the Proff of Work mechanism to creaate blocks in their network
    - ETH is moving its network to Proof of Stake
        -  test of which was launched in December 2020
    - ETH swapping the consensus mechanism of Ethereum to Proof of Staake is called ETH 2.0
- Programming Language: Execution Environment, how much a programmer caan do with the network
    - *Bitcoin has a limited programming language*
    - One of Ethereum's biggest selling point for many developers is what caalled the Etheruem Virtual Machine (EVM)
        - EVM provides a much more robust programming environment which allows people to build small, automated programs called *Smart Contracts*
        - ETH can be the baaase layer for a number of other platforms and protocols
- Developer Base: Due to the capacity of the Ethereum network compared to Bitcon, ETH has much ore robut developer base compared to Bitcoin.

## Development of the Network: EIPs, ERCs
The Ethereum community has a series of governing bodies that coordinate the maintenance andd updating of the protcol.
- Ethereum Core Developers
- Etherum Cat Herders: dedicated to "decentralized project management to suport the Ethereum network"

Changes to the Ethereum network behind as the Etherum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)
- the EIP process is a well-defined system where anyone can submit ideas to improve the network
    - EIPs are essential to the networks well-being.
- Related are Ethereum Request for Comments or ERC
    - ERCs are standard that have been agreed upon by the community
    - A well known example are community standards for common smart contracts (ERC-20, ERC-721)

Etherums extened capacity from the EVM gave rise to a broader community of developers
- distint aadvaantaages over other blockchian networks
- strong developer base
